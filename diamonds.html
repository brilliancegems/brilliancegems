  <p>Fortunately, since the discovery of large deposits throughout the world, diamonds are now available in a variety of sizes, shapes, colours and affordable price ranges.</p>

  <!-- Why Acquire a Diamond -->
  <h3>Why Acquire a Diamond?</h3>
  <p>Diamonds are seen as a token of one‚Äôs love, a status symbol, an investment or just a majestic moment that can cause such happiness every time you see it sparkle on your hand.</p>

  <h6>Brilliance</h6>
  <p>The breathtaking brilliance of a diamond is what makes them so attractive. The feeling you get when you have that special piece that you have always wanted or just watch it glitter away in its own serene beauty. It has an elegance that is second to none, conveying an aura of success that inspires feelings of pride.</p>

  <h6>Durability</h6>
  <p>A diamond is the hardest substance known to humanity. You can therefore take pride in knowing that your favourite piece will withstand the trials of time and be enjoyed by your loved ones for generations to come.</p>

  <h6>Rarity</h6>
  <p>Diamonds are becoming rarer and rare to find, especially those that are larger. Out of 250 tons of ore that is blasted, processed, crushed and filtered through, chances are there will only be one carat of rough diamonds recovered, with only a mere 20 percent of this being Gem quality.</p>

  <!-- Timeless Value Section -->
  <h6>Timeless Value</h6>
  <p>While diamond prices may fluctuate with the economy, they still maintain their value. Not to mention the sentimentality that each diamond will hold.</p>
  <p>Our selection of Pink Diamonds is renowned for its dramatic increase in value, with prices jumping dramatically every year as it is very rarely found. The imminent closure of the Argyle Pink diamond mine will again drive up prices even more dramatically. Not only do we have a fine collection of white diamonds but we are also agents of the world‚Äôs rarest pink diamond collection.</p>

  <!-- The 4 Cs Section -->
  <h3>What Determines the Value of a Diamond?</h3>
  <p>The ‚ÄúFour Cs‚Äù - Carat weight, colour, clarity and cut</p>

  <h6>Carat</h6>
  <p>A carat is equal to 200 milligrams with 142 carats to an ounce. There are 100 points to a carat. Larger diamonds are quite rare, and have a greater value per carat.</p>
  <img src="images/dm4.png" alt="Carat Weight" class="img-fluid my-3">

  <h6>Colour</h6>
  <p>Diamond can be found in any colour of the spectrum. When grading a cut diamond a valuer will often compare it to the whitest paper to see how much the colour deviates from the whitest possible (truly colourless). A diamond that is completely colourless is the rarest and therefore more valuable.</p>
  <p>We also have a fine collection of pale yellow, canary, pink, red, green, blue and brown diamonds, which are referred to as ‚Äúfancies‚Äù. These are valued for their depth of colour, just as white diamonds are valued for their lack of colour.</p>
  <img src="images/dm5.png" alt="GIA Colour Scale" class="img-fluid my-3">

  <h6>Clarity</h6>
  <p>The clarity of a diamond is determined carefully calculating the inclusions in the stone.</p>
  <img src="images/dm6.jpg" alt="GIA Clarity Scale" class="img-fluid my-3">

  <h6>Cut</h6>
  <p>A finished diamond has 58 ‚Äúfacets,‚Äù which are the small, polished planes cut into a diamond, so that the maximum amount of light is reflected back to the viewer‚Äôs eye and to get to the maximum carat weight out of the stone. The light that is reflected is referred to as ‚Äúbrilliance,‚Äù which is imperative in determining the quality of a diamond.</p>
  <p>The widest area of a diamond is classified as the ‚Äúgirdle.‚Äù Above the girdle are 32 facets plus the ‚Äútable,‚Äù the largest and topmost facet. Below the girdle there are 24 facets, plus the ‚Äúculet,‚Äù or point. Cut also deals with the shape of the diamond. Traditional shapes are round, emerald, marquise, oval, pear and heart.</p>
